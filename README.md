# Netflix Ratings Analysis

## Overview
This project explores patterns in Netflix ratings and content using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**. The dataset contains information about Netflix shows and movies, including ratings, release years, and categories.  

The goal of this analysis was to uncover trends in the data and present insights through clear, engaging visualizations. Along the way, I practiced data cleaning, EDA, and visualization techniques to turn raw data into a compelling story.

## Key Insights
Some of the questions explored in this project include:  
- Do movies or TV shows generally receive higher ratings and more engagement?
- How do age certifications (PG, R, TV-MA, etc.) relate to content popularity and ratings? 
- How has the popularity or average rating of Netflix releases changed by release year?

Through visualization and analysis, I was able to identify patterns in audience reception and highlight how Netflix‚Äôs catalog differs across categories.
